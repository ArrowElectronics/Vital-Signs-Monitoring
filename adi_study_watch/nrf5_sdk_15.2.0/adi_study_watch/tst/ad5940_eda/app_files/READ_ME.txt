To test, EDA Stand alone application

1. Connect Resistance of 10k - 5M Ohm between electrodes EB1 and EB2.
2. Run EDA_App_Test in tst/ad5940_eda/ses directory
3. Wait for application to run for 20 sec.
4. Variable "mag" and "phase" gets updated as seen on live watch, mag is approximately equal to resistance connected between EB1 and EB2.
