# ECG through AD8233 and AD5940

This ECG signal path is the default ECG signal path on the watch. The signal chain consists of:

4 electrodes -> electrode switch -> prefilter -> AD8233 -> AD5940 -> MCU

* Information on electrode conventions can be found [here](./ele.md)
* Information on electrode switch can be found [here](./ele_swtch.md)
